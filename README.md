# Intrusion-Detection-System-using-KDD-Dataset

# About the Project.

Intrusions are considered the bane of the world of cybersecurity.
Hence, developing a strong intrusion detection system which can
be used to detect abnormal network connections before hand is
vital. In this project, a simple intrusion detection system trained
on the KDD-99 dataset was demonstrated. This dataset is considered a classical benchmark for developing intrusion detection systems.

# Steps to run the code
